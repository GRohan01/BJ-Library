        Chapter 1 : Introduction to Software Engineering and process models<br>
1. Introduction<br>
Software development comprises of various stages. At every stage it is necessary to describe:
What the outcome is.<br>
Various factors that affects the product or outcome Team members involved<br>
Software engineering activities carried out.<br>

The activities and the order in which they are carried out can differ from project to project. This chapter focuses on understanding the concepts such as<br>
i.      Software and software engineering<br>
ii.	    Software process <br>
iii.	Various process models<br>

<b>2. Software</b><br>

In modern era, computer has become inevitable part of life. Use of computers in different areas is possible just because of diverse application software (many times embedded) which fulfils the demand of users in these domains. Software consist of set of programs which run on different types of computers (varying in size and architecture) providing the functionalities expected by the user.
Software can be defined as product which is build and supported by software engineers over a long period. This product consists of computer programs, contents generated as a result of program execution, data structures which help these programs to manipulate the data and descriptive information about the usage and working of software in the form of hard and soft copies.
Good software is one which provides expected functionality and performance to the user and which is easy to maintain and use. As compared to hardware, software is hard to maintain and it does not 'wear out'.<br>
<br>
3. Nature of Software Engineering<br>
Software is not manufactured like other products. Software is developed or engineered, i.e. a systematic, quantifiable and cost-effective approach is used in all aspects of software production starting from its initial conception, operation, efficiency, security and maintenance.
A definition of Software Engineering, proposed by Fritz Bauer is as follows:<br>
"The establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain economically software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines".
IEEE defines Software Engineering as:<br>
"Software Engineering: (1) The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software. (2)The study of approaches as in (1)."
Software engineers who are involved in this process should not only be worried about the technical issues but should also be aware about the ethical issues involved.<br>
Quality: Quality management is base for software engineering. Software quality can be judged using its six attributes which are as follows:<br>
a.	Functionality: If refers to the expected behaviour of the software as per the requirements of the customer.<br>
b.	Reliability: It is a probability of failure-free operations of the software over a specific period of time.<br>
c.	Usability: It refers to the ease of use of the software product.<br>
d. 	Efficiency: It refers to the efficient resource utilization by the software for achieving certain functionality.<br>
e. Maintainability: It refers to the ability of software to support modification in order to adapt the changing requirements and environments.<br>
f.	Portability: It is the ability of the software to run in different environment without change.<br>
<br>
i.	    Process: This layer tries to hold quality and technical methods together in order to deliver software in time. It defines a project context for which various documents, models, forms, reports etc. are produced.
<br>
ii.	    Methods: This layer focuses on how to build the software. It involves various tasks such as communication with stakeholders, requirements analysis, design, coding and testing.
<br>
iii.	Tools: This layer refers to automated or semi-automated tools which help the people involved to complete software processes more efficiently and with less errors. These tools can be integrated, i.e ., output produced by one tool can act as input for the other one, leading to efficient software development called as computer aided software engineering. 
<br>
Thus, in brief we can say that the main objective of software engineering is to develop a good quality software in time and with minimum cost. The main factors which affect the quality and productivity of the software developed are people involved, process followed and the tools used during the software development process.<br>
4. Changing Nature of Software<br>
Over a period of time, software has evolved from a product to a service. Software works on various computing devices ranging from main frame to mobile phones. The role of software has changed drastically with the evolution in technology and now software industry is playing an important role in world's economy.
Before developing a particular software, a software engineer must know what type of software to be developed and accordingly proper design and implementation (software engineering) techniques should be applied.
The four broad categories of software which are dominating the software industry and becoming more challenging to the software engineers are as follows:<br>
i.	    Web Apps: Web applications run on web browser and uses web technology for performing its task. The emergence of web 3.0 (also called as Semantic Web Technologies)provides not only dynamic web pages with information content and computing capabilities but also web linking, access to external APIs and flexible representation of data. Today web based systems and web applications interact with corporate database and business applications.
<br>
ii.	    Mobile Applications: The software which is designed specifically for mobile platforms like android, iOS, Windows. Mobile app provides a user interface and uses the local processing and storage capabilities of the device. A mobile web application access web content using the web browser specifically designed for the mobile device.
<br>
iii.	Cloud Computing: Basically, allows sharing of resources. A cloud architecture can be public or private. It allows user to access resources from anywhere, anytime using any computing device which resides outside the cloud. The resources within a cloud can be applications, infrastructures and database or data structures storing data. Cloud computing is implemented using front-end and back-end service architecture. Front-end encompasses computing device and application that the client uses while back-end refers to server and related resources together with middleware to coordinate and monitor the to and from traffic.
<br>
iv.	Product-line Software: It focuses on mass consumer market or specific market area. Software is developed for common functionality identified among many products within the product line. It is implemented using set of software components which are reusable.Set of outcomes resulted through software engineering and which are shared by a software product-line includes requirements, architecture, design patterns, reusable components, test cases etc.
<br>
5. Software Process<br>
<br>
Software process is core of software engineering. Software project specifies what is to be developed as per the user's requirements as shown in figure 1.2. Software process is the set of related tasks/activities carried out in order to produce the required software (for completing the project) in time.<br>
Each task performs a well-defined function and produces concrete output. The process becomes very important because it doesn't just aim to deliver a desired software but tries to produce a high-quality software within less time and cost. Software process is not static or rigid but it is dynamic or adaptable in nature. Each of the activities and tasks resides within a framework or model, which specifies the relation between process and these activities and also the relation among the activities itself.<br>
<br>
5.1 The Process Framework<br>
The process framework provides a support structure for entire software engineering in the form of set of activities. These activities are applicable to all software projects irrespective of its size. Complexity and type. It mainly consists of framework activities and umbrella activities. Every framework activity includes set of actions performed for completion of the activity. Each action in turn is composed of set of tasks which completed the defined action.<br>
The basic activities included in generic software process framework are
1.	Communication: In order to understand the objective, functionality, limits and features of the software it required to communicate with the customer and other stake holders before starting any technical work. This includes various meetings and reports produced as a result of the meetings.<br>
<br>
2.	Planning: 'Fail to plan, plan to fail. Planning always help in smooth working of a leam towards the goal. A plan created for completing the software project is called 'software project plan. This plan identifies and specifies the risks involved, resources required, sequence of technical tasks to be performed, work products produced and schedule for the work.<br>
<br>
3.	Modeling: An abstract representation of existing or planned system is nothing but a model. Creating model helps in better understanding of requirements and proposed design to achieve these requirements.<br>
<br>
4.	Construction: It involves the actual coding for the designed software and testing the code in various ways in order to identify the errors<br>
<br>
5.	Deployment: The complete or partial software developed is delivered to the customer. After the evaluation, the customer gives feedback for the software which can be used for further improvements.<br>
<br>
5.2 Umbrella Activities<br>
These are the activities which are performed throughout the entire software project. Umbrella activities are as follows :<br>
1.	Software Project Tracking and Control: <br>
As the name suggests, these set of activities help development team to track progress of project by comparing it against the schedule Corrective measures are taken in order to maintain the schedule.<br>
<br>
2.	Formal Technical Reviews: <br>
Reviews the product and techniques used for the development of the product. Feedbacks received after the review help in finding bugs or errors in the product before moving to next stage.<br>
<br>
3.	Software Quality Assurance: <br>
These are the activities which tries to ensure quality of the product developed.<br>
<br>
4.	 Software Configuration Management: <br>
These set of activities tries to manage and control changes throughout the software process.<br>
<br>
5.	Work product Preparation and Production:<br>
Encompasses activities that are required to create and maintain details about the work product such as models, forms, logs, documents etc.<br>
<br>
6.	Re-usability Management:<br>
Defines and establishes mechanism for reusability of software components vii. Risk Management: These set of activities measures risk involved which may affect the quality of the product or the output of the product.<br>
<br>
7.	Measurement and Metrics:<br>
Defines and collects measures for assessing the product so that customer satisfaction can be achieved.<br>
<br>
5.3 Process Adaptation<br>
Software process should be flexible and accommodative in nature. It should be dynamic and adaptable to the project, to the team and to the organization as a whole.<br>
It is possible that a software process used for one project may differ with another in the following areas:<br>
I.	Sequence of activities and tasks performed and their dependencies on each other. <br>
II.	Identification of required work products and their dept of implementation.<br>
III.	Quality assurance techniques and activities used.<br>
IV.	Techniques and activities used for project tracking and control activities.<br>
V.	Stress given on details of process description.<br>
VI.	Level of liberty given to the software team.<br>
VII.	Details about the roles played by individuals in a development team.<br>
